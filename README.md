## Demo

## Features

- Works out of the box with a single `require('mini.animate').setup()`. No extra mappings or commands needed.
- Animate **cursor movement** inside same buffer by showing customizable path.
- Animate **scrolling** with a series of subscrolls ("smooth scrolling").
- Animate **window resize** by gradually changing sizes of all windows.
- Animate **window open/close** with visually updating floating window.
- Timings for all actions can be customized independently.
- Action animations can be enabled/disabled independently.
- All animations are asynchronous/non-blocking and trigger a targeted event which can be used to perform actions after animation is done.
- `MiniAnimate.animate()` function which can be used to perform own animations.

Notes:

- Scroll and resize animations actually change Neovim state to achieve their effects and are asynchronous. This can cause following issues:
    - If you have remapped any movement operation to center after it is done (like with `nzvzz` or `<C-d>zz`), you need to change those mappings. Either remove them or update to use `MiniAnimate.execute_after()` (see `:h MiniAnimate.config.scroll`)
    - Using mouse wheel to scroll can appear slower or can have visual jitter. This usually happens due to high number of wheel turns per second: each turn is taking over previous one to start new animation. To mitigate this, you can either modify 'mousescroll' option (set vertical scroll to 1 and use high turn speed or set to high value and use one turn at a time) or `config.scroll` to fine tune when/how scroll animation is done.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.animate').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Cursor path
  cursor = {
    -- Whether to enable this animation
    enable = true,

    -- Timing of animation (how steps will progress in time)
    timing = --<function: implements linear total 250ms animation duration>,

    -- Path generator for visualized cursor movement
    path = --<function: implements shortest line path no longer than 1000>,
  },

  -- Vertical scroll
  scroll = {
    -- Whether to enable this animation
    enable = true,

    -- Timing of animation (how steps will progress in time)
    timing = --<function: implements linear total 250ms animation duration>,

    -- Subscroll generator based on total scroll
    subscroll = --<function: implements equal scroll with at most 60 steps>,
  },

  -- Window resize
  resize = {
    -- Whether to enable this animation
    enable = true,

    -- Timing of animation (how steps will progress in time)
    timing = --<function: implements linear total 250ms animation duration>,

    -- Subresize generator for all steps of resize animations
    subresize = --<function: implements equal linear steps>,
  },

  -- Window open
  open = {
    -- Whether to enable this animation
    enable = true,

    -- Timing of animation (how steps will progress in time)
    timing = --<function: implements linear total 250ms animation duration>,

    -- Floating window config generator visualizing specific window
    winconfig = --<function: implements static window for 25 steps>,

    -- 'winblend' (window transparency) generator for floating window
    winblend = --<function: implements equal linear steps from 80 to 100>,
  },

  -- Window close
  close = {
    -- Whether to enable this animation
    enable = true,

    -- Timing of animation (how steps will progress in time)
    timing = --<function: implements linear total 250ms animation duration>,

    -- Floating window config generator visualizing specific window
    winconfig = --<function: implements static window for 25 steps>,

    -- 'winblend' (window transparency) generator for floating window
    winblend = --<function: implements equal linear steps from 80 to 100>,
  },
}
```
